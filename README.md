# SurvivalShooter
A sample unity game where I am experimenting new features and other epic stuffs in my free time. Thanks unity for the game template !
The base game is a player shooting enemies which eventually will try to overwhelm the player. A score system is also there.

## New Functionalities 
- __Added healthbar for enemies__

>Enemies will hame a small healthbar on top of them so that player can see how much health is remaining. Strategy is to help player >determine the enemy health so that tthey can prioritise whom to shoot and run away as enemies tend to overwhelm the player.

- __Killed enemies drop point balls which can be collected by player__

>Once an enemy is killed, it will drop a point ball which can be collected by the player for extra points. Different enemies drop >different coloured balls with varying points.

- __Health Bar fluctuation when under attack by player__

>When an enemy is under attack by the player , its health bar will flash. It helps player to know which enemy is getting hit when firing >the gun.

- __Probability system in enemies droping point balls and point balls expiry__

>A system is implemented in which not all the enemies will drop the point balls. Its based on probability that a killed enemy has 50% >chance to drop a point ball and other 50% chance to not drop a point ball.
>Also a point ball has a specified time period after which it will disapper. So player has to collect it before it disapper to get the >points

- __Pause and exit functionality__

>Implemented UI elements to pause the game and also to exit the game as player wishes.

- __Extra Sounds__

>Extra sounds are added , lastest being sound for collecting the point balls.
